# Hotcrawler

>Ever wondered why pornhub's age filter never worked? Well, I've made it work. Sort of. Here's a (very) messy script that crawls the pornstars and keeps their `rank`, `name`, `age`, `gender` and `url` so that you may browse all the freshies out there at will. - [Fsalker](https://github.com/Fsalker/Hotcrawler)



# Running
1. `npm i`
2. `node voyeur.js -- help` to see te options
3. Explore `./crawledData` and browse your spicy data at will with your favorite JSON viewer
